Hello! I'm hooshik. 👨‍💻

After graduating from college, I realized that the coding education I received there didn't provide me with the skills I needed. However, everything changed when I joined the 42 Seoul program.

I immersed myself in coding education that truly made a difference. Unlike my college experience, the hands-on learning environment and innovative approach at 42 Seoul empowered me to develop practical coding skills that have been incredibly beneficial.

Through this transformative experience, I've not only gained proficiency in various programming languages but also learned the importance of perseverance and self-directed learning. I'm now actively applying these skills and principles in my current endeavors.

I believe in challenging myself and constantly striving for improvement. I refuse to settle for mediocrity and am committed to continuous growth and development. 🚀

I'm thrilled to be part of this community and look forward to connecting with fellow enthusiasts who share my passion for learning and self-improvement! 💡

### Interests and Current Learning Focus

1. Currently, I'm focusing on learning about the SIP protocol and all related protocols.   
   
2. I'm also actively learning advanced patterns in TypeScript and React, as well as developing iOS apps using React Native and Swift. 📱

3. I have a keen interest in customizing GPT using ChatGPT for various applications. 🤖
